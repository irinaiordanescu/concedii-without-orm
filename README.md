This project started my bachelor thesis, where I wrote about the importance of ORM.

This project doesn't run an ORM for the sole purpose of having one that does, and run a comparison.

## Requirements
In order to run, you will need to have installed: ```JAVA, MySQL, Glassfish```

After that, you will have to compile the project and run it
